##Algorithms & Problem-Solving
This project contains 50 algorithmic problems solved using C++. The focus of this project is on problem-solving techniques, particularly using the Divide and Conquer approach, as well as leveraging functions to solve problems efficiently and in an organized manner.

#How to Run the Code
To run the code, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. You can use a compiler like G++ on Linux or MinGW on Windows. After installation, you can compile and run any of the code files in the directories using the following command
Where filename.cpp is the name of the file you want to compile, and output_name is the name of the executable file that will be created.

If you'd like to run a specific problem, simply place the code in the main.cpp file to execute it. This project is designed to be used with the CLion IDE, which is set up for easy execution.

#Project Contents
This project covers a variety of algorithmic problems that include Divide and Conquer techniques and innovative approaches to problem-solving. Functions are used to achieve code reusability, allowing for flexible and simplified reuse of the code in other projects.

The project is designed to provide robust and efficient solutions to a wide range of programming challenges that can be applied across various domains.
